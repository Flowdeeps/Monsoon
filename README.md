# Monsoon
Monsoon Is a variation of mutable instruments clouds with separate CV and controls for the 4 "blend" functions.

12Hp eurorack module.

The 4 LEDs on the sliders indicate incoming control voltage for the 4 main parameters, this is done in hardware, with 4 LM321 op amps. you can replace the rectangular LEDs in the sliders with bidirectional round 3mm red/green or any other 2 color LED, the leg spacing is the same.

The button which used to select blend parameters now simply switches the display between audio input monitoring and monitoring the 4 blend amounts.
